                <h3>What is a bone marrow biopsy?</h3>
                <p>Bone marrow is the soft part inside your bone which makes your blood cells. In a bone marrow biopsy we take one or more samples including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bone marrow aspirate</strong> – this is where we take a small sample of fluid from inside your hipbone (pelvis). These samples are then looked at under a microscope.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bone marrow trephine</strong> – this is where we take a small sample (core) of your bone marrow using a hollow needle. It can then be looked at under a microscope.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Why do I need this test?</h3>
                <p>You may need a bone marrow test because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We have found a problem with your blood which needs to be looked into. By looking closely at your bone marrow, we may be able to find out why there are changes in your blood. This can help us to make a diagnosis and start you on the right treatment.</li>
                    <li>you are already receiving treatment for a blood disorder, so that we can see how the treatment is working.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What are the risks?</h3>
                <p>Bone marrow tests are low risk. You may have some bleeding in the area where the needle is put in. This usually stops when pressure is put on the site, but you can be left with a small bruise. You may develop an infection. This is rare and you can reduce the risk by keeping the area clean and dry after the test for 24 hours.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Are there any alternatives?</h3>
                <p>No. The only way to diagnose a problem in your blood is by looking at where it is made – in your bone marrow. A bone marrow test is required when either a diagnosis has not, or cannot, be made based on blood test results alone.</p>
